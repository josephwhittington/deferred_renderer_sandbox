# Shit that needs to get done

# Video
- Do the thing

## High Priority Shit
- Rework renderpipeline to me OOP based
- Fix FBX Loader
- Get textures loading
- Get Phong lighting working

## Low Priority Shit (Nice to have's) [may become high priority if the project calls for rearchitecting]
- OBJ Loader
- OBJ/ FBX to Header exporter
- OBJ/ FBX property editor
- Single-file Shaders
	- This would use a pragma style header to mark the beginning of a shader type 
	- The shader would then concat the types into a string and then compile
- Shader class that stores the precompiled binaries in memory and keeps shit low key
